## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of vehicle repairs. By examining the dataset, we aim to identify trends and insights that can inform better decision-making in vehicle maintenance and repair services. The analysis includes various aspects such as:

- **Repair Types**: Understanding the most common types of repairs.
- **Costs**: Analyzing the cost distribution across different repairs.
- **Vehicle Platforms**: Identifying which vehicle platforms incur higher repair costs.

## Features

- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning to ensure data quality
- Insights extraction for actionable outcomes
- Tag generation from free-text fields
- Visualizations to present findings clearly
- Saving of cleaned datasets for further analysis

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several powerful libraries and tools:

- **Python**: The main programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive coding environment.
- **Counter**: For counting hashable objects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyberTokyo112/data-analysis-using-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd data-analysis-using-python
```

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook file:

```bash
jupyter notebook vehicle_repairs_analysis.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis step by step.

## Data Cleaning Process

Data cleaning is crucial for ensuring the quality of analysis. In this project, we perform the following steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and address missing data points.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensure unique entries in the dataset.
3. **Standardizing Formats**: Normalize formats for dates, text, and numerical values.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers that may skew results.

## Insights Extraction

After cleaning the data, we extract insights to understand trends. Key insights include:

- Most common repair types and their frequencies.
- Average costs associated with different repair types.
- Trends over time in repair requests.

These insights can guide businesses in making informed decisions.

## Tag Generation

Generating tags from free-text fields helps in categorizing data. This project uses simple string processing techniques to create meaningful tags. For example, repairs described as "engine failure" may be tagged as "engine" and "failure."

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a vital role in presenting findings. The project includes various charts and graphs to illustrate insights, such as:

- Bar charts showing the frequency of repair types.
- Box plots displaying cost distributions.
- Line graphs illustrating trends over time.

These visualizations make it easier to understand complex data at a glance.
